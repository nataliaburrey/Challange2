* Inmproving usability of Loan Qualifier for users

> "After successfully developing The Loan Qualifier application, I decided to improve usability for not-so-technical users. 
With this new improvement my software can prompt the user to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file.
"

# Technologies 

The progect was written in Python, using Visual Studio Code to modified the original file. 
I used Terminal on MacOC to run the code and later to create repository,upload and modified files on GitHub. 
Conda (dev) inviroment was activated. Multiple libriries was called to use by following commands:

``` 
import cvs
import sys
import fire
import questionary
from pathlib import Path 
```
[For more information on libryries:]( https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html?highlight=csv#module-csv )
